    <p>Yes, it's pretty terrible. But we're going to turn it into responsive scrollytelling anyway.</p>

        <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each button should be turned into a step (scroll down to see them).</li>
          <li>When I resize, the graphic should scale to the <strong>width of its container, but not the height</strong>.</li>
          <li>It would be nice if you gave me a sentence to pretend this is a story instead of just "here's Africa!" Not that we have a strong story, of course.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>It should look like <a href="assets/chart-1.mp4">this</a> when you're done.</p>

        <p>
          <a><strong>Asian</strong> countries have life expectancies across the spectrum, although some of the very longest-lived countries are in Asia.</a>

      <div class='step' id="africa-step">
        <p>
          <a><strong>Africa</strong> contains all of the countries with the lowest life expectancies, although many African states are solidly in the upper-middle of the spectrum.</a>

        <p>
          <a><strong>North America</strong> comprises haves and have-nots. Some Caribbean and Latin American countries have middling life expectancies, while others are nearly as long-lived as Canada and the United States.</a>

        <p>
          <a><strong>Low-GDP countries</strong> generally have lower life expectancies, but a handful boast decent longevity in spite of poverty.</a>

      <div class='step' id="continent-step">
        <p>
